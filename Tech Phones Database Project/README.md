**Welcome to "TechPhones" Database Project**

**Introduction:**

Welcome to the TechPhones project! This repository contains a comprehensive SQL database named "TechPhones," designed specifically for managing a phone shop's operations efficiently. Whether you're a developer, data analyst, or simply interested in exploring SQL databases, this project provides valuable insights and advanced querying techniques.

**Database Overview:**

The TechPhones database comprises nine tables, each serving a distinct purpose in organizing and managing the phone shop's data:

Customers: Stores information about customers.
Employees: Manages employee details.
Departments: Tracks various departments within the shop.
Orders: Records order details.
OrderDetails: Contains specifics about order items.
Payment: Manages payment information.
Phones: Stores details about available phone models.
PhoneReviews: Stores customer reviews for phones.
Suppliers: Manages supplier information.
Advanced Queries and Window Functions:
The repository includes a plethora of advanced SQL queries, utilizing various types of joins and employing window functions extensively to extract insightful information from the database. Here's a glimpse of what you'll find:

**Joins:**
Utilizing INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, and FULL JOIN to merge data from multiple tables.

**Window Functions:** 

Leveraging window functions such as LEAD, LAG, FIRST_VALUE, LAST_VALUE, RANK, DENSE_RANK, along with the OVER and PARTITION BY clauses to perform complex analytical tasks within the database.

**Subqueries:** 

Employing subqueries to break down complex problems into manageable components, enhancing query readability and efficiency.

**Common Table Expressions (CTEs):**

Leveraging CTEs to create temporary result sets, facilitating recursive queries and enhancing query modularity.



**Example Queries**


# Retrieve Department Name and the Total Sales They Make
SELECT
    d.DepartmentName,
    SUM(d.sales) AS TotalSales
FROM
	Department d
GROUP BY
    d.DepartmentName


# Use a Subquery to Retrieve The Details of Employees Who Earn More Than The Average Salary
SELECT *
FROM 
	Employees e
JOIN 
	(SELECT AVG(SALARY) AS AverageSalary 
		FROM Employees) AS sal
		ON e.Salary > sal.AverageSalary;
  

# Use CTE to Retrieve Employees Who Earn More Than The Average Salary
WITH average_salary (average_sal) AS
	(SELECT AVG(e.Salary) FROM Employees e)
SELECT e.FirstName, e.LastName, e.Salary, average_sal
FROM Employees e, average_salary 
WHERE e.Salary > average_sal


# Use Window Function, OVER And Partition By To Retrieve Details of IT Employees And The Average Salary In IT Department
SELECT 
    e.EmployeeID,
    e.FirstName,
    e.LastName,
    e.Position,
    e.Phone,
    e.Salary,
    d.DepartmentName,
    AVG(e.Salary) OVER (PARTITION BY d.DepartmentName) AS AverageSalaryInDepartment
FROM 
    Employees e
JOIN 
    Department d ON e.EmployeeID = d.EmployeeID
WHERE 
    d.DepartmentName = "IT";
