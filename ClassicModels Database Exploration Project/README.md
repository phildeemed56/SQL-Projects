**Welcome to "ClassicModels Database Exploration" Project**

**Introduction:**

Welcome to the ClassicModels Database Exploration project! This repository contains an in-depth exploration of the ClassicModels sample database, showcasing advanced SQL querying techniques. Whether you're a budding developer, seasoned data analyst, or simply intrigued by the world of databases, this project offers valuable insights and practical examples.

**Database Overview:**

The ClassicModels database is a classic example frequently used for learning SQL concepts and techniques. It represents a fictional company that sells scale models of classic cars. The database comprises multiple tables, including customers, employees, products, orders, and more, providing a rich dataset for analysis and querying.

Advanced Queries and Techniques:
In this project, we delve deep into the ClassicModels database, employing advanced SQL querying techniques to extract valuable insights:

Joins: Utilizing INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, and FULL JOIN to merge data from multiple tables seamlessly.

Window Functions: Leveraging window functions such as ROW_NUMBER, RANK, DENSE_RANK, LEAD, and LAG to perform complex analytical tasks within the database.

Subqueries: Employing subqueries to break down complex problems into manageable components, enhancing query readability and efficiency.


Example Queries

--Compare sales performance across regions for different product lines.
SELECT 
   CASE
       WHEN c.country IN ('USA', 'Canada', 'Mexico') THEN 'North America'
       WHEN c.country IN ('UK', 'France', 'Germany', 'Italy', 'Spain') THEN 'Europe'
       ELSE 'Other'
   END AS region,
   p.productLine,
   SUM(od.quantityOrdered * od.priceEach) AS totalSales
FROM customers c
JOIN orders o ON c.customerNumber = o.customerNumber
JOIN orderdetails od ON o.orderNumber = od.orderNumber
JOIN products p ON od.productCode = p.productCode
GROUP BY region, p.productLine
ORDER BY region, totalSales DESC;


-- Calculate the average order volume for each day of the week.
SELECT DAYNAME(orderDate) AS dayOfWeek, 
       AVG(orderCount) AS avgOrderCount
FROM (
    SELECT orderDate, COUNT(orderNumber) AS orderCount
    FROM orders
    GROUP BY orderDate
) AS daily_orders
GROUP BY dayOfWeek
ORDER BY avgOrderCount DESC;
